# CSEPyDataChallenge

In this challenge you will be modifying the function in the given code file
named challengeCode.py 

Your task is to analyze the argument and find out what data type the argument is.

You would do this with the help of the type() built in function. Refer to 3.1.2, section about data type chart.

```
type("hello") #result is str
```

Once you have found out what data type it is complete the challenge by doing something with the arg and return it to the user.

*For example:*
A string would be concatenated to another string
A number can be added to another number
True can be True or Negated to False

It is entirely up to you, just dont change the data types return them modified but same data type.

Github will be evaluating your assignment.
